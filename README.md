# Drone-PDP-PCB-Design
Welcome to my Power Delivery Platform (PDP) PCB design project, a reliable and efficient solution for power delivery applications. This project was designed using Proteus software, a popular tool for PCB design and simulation. The goal of this project is to provide a high-performance PDP PCB that meets the required specifications and standards.

Unique Point: "High-Efficiency Power Delivery Solution Designed with Proteus Software for Accurate Simulation and Verification"

Features

- High-current handling capability (up to 10A)
- Multiple power output channels (3V, 5V, 12V)
- Overcurrent and overvoltage protection (OCP/OVP)
- High-efficiency power conversion (>90%)
- Compact design (50mm x 50mm) for space-saving applications
- Easy-to-use interface (headers for simple connections)
Design Files

- Proteus design files (.pcb and .sch) for modification and editing
- Gerber files (RS-274X format) for fabrication
- Schematic and PCB layout files for easy understanding and modification

Manufactured Images
The Manufactured_Images folder contains high-quality images of the fabricated PCB, including:

- Top and bottom layer images
- Populated and unpopulated board images
- Detailed images of specific features (e.g., connectors, components)

License
This design is released under the MIT License, allowing for free use, modification, and distribution.

Acknowledgments
This design was created using Proteus software, and the author would like to acknowledge the support of Labcenter Electronics and the open-source hardware community.
